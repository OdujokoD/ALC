This is supposed to be a challenge., however it can be used by beginners to get a feel of building a basic android application

## Challenge

Build an Android app to retrieve a list of Java Developers in Lagos using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users)
* Display the list of developers on a list. Each item on the list should have:
	* User’s profile image
	* User’s GitHub username
* Clicking each item on the list should show their profile details.
* The profile screen should contain:
	* Username
	* Profile photo
	* Github profile URL
	* Button to share their profile, and it should launch a share intent and the content of the share should be “Check out this awesome developer @**github username**, **github profile url**.”
	* Clicking on the Github url should launch the browser and link to their Github page.


## Introduction

When developing, I prefer to follow these steps:
* Create my mockups/sketches
* If database is required, I will plan out the design of the database
* Breakdown the problem into small chunks
* Check if there is a *good* library to handle tasks else plan the implementation of the task
* Get the hands dirty

The reason for following these steps comes from experience on several projects (both android and non-android projets). First, it reduces the implementation time drastically. Second, it helps to keep track of progress on the project.
